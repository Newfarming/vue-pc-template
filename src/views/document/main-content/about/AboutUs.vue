    <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>In the fall of 2013, the 25-year-old Vincent Lou left Facebook and started this business.</p>
      <p class="p-br">His passion for products and frustration with the lack of transparency in pricing led them to build Club Factory.</p>
      <p class="p-br">While the team skews young, our employees have cut their teeth at places like Amazon, Facebook, Gap, Zara, and J.Crew. We share the passion for pushing boundaries and challenging conventions.</p>
      <p>If you are a rule breaker, questioner, student who skip classes, join us! Contact us at hr@clubfactory.com</p>
