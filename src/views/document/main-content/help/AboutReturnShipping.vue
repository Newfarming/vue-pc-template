      <p>You can either schedule a pickup or mail the return package by yourself.</p>
      <p>The pickup fee is â‚¹90/package, which will be deducted from your refund total. But if it is our fault for a return (like wrong products or damaged products), please find customer service under My Account for a free pickup.</p>

      <p>If the return is due to a Club Factory error, we will refund return shipping costs up to a certain amount. You will need to pay the carrier at the time of shipping. The return shipping costs will be covered along with the refund.</p>
      <p>If the return is not due to a Club Factory error, you will need to pay for the return shipping. We recommend that you choose the local post with a cheaper price.</p>
      <p class="notice p-br">*Notice: We strongly recommend that you NOT use FedEx or DHL for return. It would result in high customs fees.</p>
